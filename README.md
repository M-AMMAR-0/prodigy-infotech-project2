Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the famous Titanic dataset using Power BI to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival rates. The analysis delves into various aspects such as passenger demographics, ticket class, and fare paid, providing insights into the survival probability of different groups aboard the Titanic.

Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset, which is widely used for machine learning and data analysis projects. The dataset includes the following key features:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Ticket fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Key Features
Survival Rate Analysis: Visual breakdown of survival rates by different demographics such as age, gender, and class.
Demographic Insights: Exploration of how passenger demographics (e.g., gender, age, family size) influenced survival chances.
Class & Fare Analysis: Analysis of survival rates based on ticket class and fare paid, revealing the impact of socio-economic status.
Embarkation Point Analysis: Insights into how the port of embarkation affected passenger survival.
Correlation & Heatmaps: Use of heatmaps to identify correlations between different variables and survival rates.
Visualizations
Survival by Gender: A bar chart comparing survival rates between male and female passengers.
Survival by Class: A stacked bar chart showing survival rates across different ticket classes.
Age Distribution: A histogram showing the age distribution of survivors and non-survivors.
Fare vs. Survival: A scatter plot analyzing the relationship between fare paid and survival probability.
Embarkation Analysis: A pie chart and map visualizing survival rates based on the port of embarkation
